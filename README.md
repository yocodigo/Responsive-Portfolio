# Responsive-Portfolio

## Introduction
Welcome to my portfolio! Here I showcase some of my favorite web apps using a variety of technologies and libraries in a responsive site. The objective here was to seamlessly change the layout regardless of what platform its being rendered on or the size of screen. 

Thank you for stopping by!
